# rock-paper-scissors

An implementation of the rock paper scissors game for JavaScript. I had already 
created a python version of this before, so the logic was easy to remember. It 
basically uses prompts to get user input, a random function to get the computer's 
hand from a list, and basic if - else for the game logic, a while loop for the game 
to go for 5 rounds, some flags to calculate who wins and a score variable which 
gets updated thereby and which decides the victor.
